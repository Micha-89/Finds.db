# Finds.db

Metal detecting, and searching for stone age artifacts have become more and more popular over recent years. Registering the find location of these artifacts is important to localize potential archeological sites. This is however not done by every hobby archeologist. That's why I wanted to create a web application that makes this process easy and fast, so people are encouraged to register the location.

### Which stack and tools?

This is a full-stack application with CRUD functionality for 3 models. 
I built this using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).</br>
I used Passport for the sign-up and login, Axios for the API requests, Cloudinary for the picture upload, Mapbox-react-gl to use the Mapbox API, and React-chartjs-2 for the charts.
